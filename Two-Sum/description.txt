Description of the problem:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

My initial thoughts on the problem:
I could have just done a brute force implementation and gotten an O(n^2) time complexity for the function but I wanted to challenge myself since 
this was the first leetcode problem I had ever done. I decided I could at minimum get an O(n) time complexity due to the requirement of traversing an array
of "n" complexity. I decided to use a hashmap to go through and try to find a pair faster that added up to the target sum.

My thoughts after I found the easier solution
I seriously overcomplicated this Leetcoding question and did not understand how simple you could make it! I look forward to simplifying and understanding 
my code further. Even though my time complexity wasn't terrible there are definitely areas of improvement within my code. I recreated the easier solution 
with a more complex solution.
